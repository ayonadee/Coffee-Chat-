# Project Scope

Networking in tech and any field in general is an essential and 
sure-fire way to get your foot in the door and even perhaps 
jump the queue a couple of steps. However it is often 
difficult to keep track of the various people and 
discussions you have along the way. 

Introducing... Coffee Chat:

A networking contact book app that 
allows users to store contact details, key 
information and memories that the 
user has pertaining to the individuals they 
have encountered at networking events, meetups,
 conferences etc.
