# Coffee Chat
Author: Ayona Duncan

# Project Scope

In general, networking in any field - particularly in 
the field of technology- is an essential and 
sure-fire way of providing opportunities for employment,growth
and exposure. However it can be difficult to track where
and when connections were made, making it tedious to
circle back to these connects when you're job hunting and would
like to arrange a coffee chat. 

Introducing.... Coffee Chat:

A networking 'calling card' storage app that 
allows users to store contact details, name of company, position 
and other key information and memories that the 
user has pertaining to the individuals they 
have encountered at networking events, meetups,
 conferences etc. No more misplacing and exchanging thousands of 
 calling cards, no more random numbers in your phone with no recollection
 of how and when you met.
